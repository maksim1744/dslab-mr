# Graph drawing

This tools allows to draw graphs using simulation trace. An example for all available graph types can be found in the folder [graphs](./graphs). These graphs were drawn from the trace generated by first creating `graph_plan` using [alibaba_parser](../alibaba_parser/) and then running [run_experiment](../run_experiment/) with the following config:
```yaml
plans:
- plan_path: ../../alibaba/graph_plan/plan.yaml
  dags_path: ../../alibaba/graph_plan/dags
systems:
- systems/tree.yaml
replication_strategies:
- Random[replication_factor=3,chunk_distribution=ProhibitSameRack]
placement_strategies:
- PackingScheduler[other_rack_input_penalty=0.01,other_host_input_penalty=0.01]
```
